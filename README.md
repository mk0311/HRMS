**HLD for HRMS**


**1. System Architecture:**

The HRMS tool will be developed using the MERN stack, which consists of:
    
    MongoDB: For the database layer.
    
    Express.js: For building the backend server and APIs.
    
    React.js: For the frontend user interface.
    
    Node.js: For server-side runtime environment.


**2. Modules:**

The HRMS system can be divided into several modules:

    Authentication: Handles user authentication and authorization.
    
    Employee Management: Manages employee profiles, records, and related information.
    
    Leave Management: Tracks employee leave requests, approvals, and balances.
    
    Attendance Tracking: Records employee attendance and generates reports.
    
    Payroll Management: Manages payroll processing, including salary calculation, deductions, and tax calculations.
    
    Performance Management: Tracks employee performance, goals, and reviews.
    
    Recruitment: Manages the recruitment process, including job postings, applications, and candidate evaluations.

**3. Database Schema:**

MongoDB will be used as the database to store HR-related data. Sample collections might include:

    Users: Stores user credentials and roles.
    
    Employees: Contains employee profiles, including personal and employment information.
    
    LeaveRequests: Stores leave requests submitted by employees.
    
    Attendance: Records employee attendance data.
    
    Payroll: Contains salary details, deductions, and tax information.
    
    Performance: Stores performance reviews, goals, and feedback.

**4. Backend APIs:**

Express.js will be used to create RESTful APIs to handle CRUD operations and business logic for each module. For example:

    /api/auth: Handles user authentication and authorization.
    
    /api/employees: CRUD operations for managing employee data.
    
    /api/leave: Manages leave requests and balances.
    
    /api/attendance: Handles attendance tracking functionalities.
    
    /api/payroll: Manages payroll processing.
    
    /api/performance: Handles performance management functionalities.
    
    /api/recruitment: Manages recruitment-related operations.

**5. Frontend Components:**

React.js will be used to create the user interface components for the HRMS tool. These components will interact with the backend APIs to fetch and display data, as well as to perform actions such as submitting leave requests or updating employee information.

    Authentication Pages: Login, registration, and password reset pages.
    
    Employee Dashboard: Displays employee information, leave balances, attendance summary, etc.
    
    Leave Management Interface: Allows employees to request leave and managers to approve/reject requests.
    
    Payroll Dashboard: Displays salary details, tax information, etc.
    
    Performance Review Interface: Allows employees and managers to set goals, conduct reviews, and provide feedback.

**6. Security:**

Implement security measures such as encryption for sensitive data, authentication, and authorization mechanisms to ensure data privacy and prevent unauthorized access.

**7. Scalability and Performance:**

Design the system to handle a large number of users and data efficiently. Consider using techniques like load balancing, caching, and optimizing database queries for better performance.

**8. Testing:**

Implement unit tests and integration tests to ensure the reliability and stability of the system. Use tools like Jest for frontend testing and Mocha/Chai for backend testing.

**9. Deployment:**

Deploy the application on cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Heroku for scalability and accessibility. Utilize CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment and continuous integration.

**Conclusion:**

This HLD outlines the key components and architecture of an HRMS tool developed using the MERN stack. It covers modules, database schema, backend APIs, frontend components, security, scalability, testing, and deployment considerations.
